# Touch Power

The Touch Power driver used by Lumias for gating P-States linked to the digitizer.

## What does this driver do?

This driver gates power states for the digitizer. It allows Windows Power Framework to know that the digitizer is power managed, and provides an interface to toggle between the on P-State, or off.
